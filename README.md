- Created `turn_right()` and `jump()` functions  
- Used loops and if-else to guide the robot through a maze  

**What I Learned:**
- Importance of reusable functions  
- Better logic building using conditions and loops  

**Screenshots:**  
Included 5 screenshots showing code and final output in Reeborg’s World.

### Day 7 - Hangman Game 🎯  
A Python version of the classic Hangman game. The player tries to guess the hidden word by entering letters. Wrong guesses reduce lives, and ASCII art shows the Hangman's progress.

- `hangman_words.py`: Contains the word list  
- `hangman_art.py`: Contains the hangman stages and game logo (ASCII art)

### Day 8 - Caesar Cipher 🔁🔐  
A text encryption/decryption tool that shifts letters in the alphabet by a user-defined number.

**Features:**
- Encode and decode messages  
- Handles non-alphabet characters without changing them  
- Supports repeated use until user exits  
- Uses ASCII logo from external module `art.py`
